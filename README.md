## Description

This project is a simple web application that allows users to collect, display, and interact with employee data using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Main Features:

- Selecting Random Employee: Users can randomly select and display an employee from the entered data.

Additionally, it features error handling to prevent null elements when displaying the average salary.
